# Usage of the Words Helm and Chart
**There are a few conventions for using the words Helm and helm.**

**Helm** refers to the project as a whole

**helm** refers to the client-side command

The term **chart** does not need to be capitalized, as it is not a proper noun

However, **Chart.yaml** does need to be capitalized because the file name is case sensitive

**When in doubt, use Helm (with an uppercase 'H').**
