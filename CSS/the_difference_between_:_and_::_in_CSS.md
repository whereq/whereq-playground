# The Difference Between Pseudo-Classes (`:`) and Pseudo-Elements (`::`) in CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) uses colons (`:`) and double colons (`::`) in selectors to target elements in different ways. Here's a breakdown:

#### Pseudo-Classes (`:`)
- Pseudo-classes are selected using a single colon (`:`) and style elements based on states or conditions like user interactions.
- Example:

```css
a:hover {  
  color: red;  
}
```

- Common pseudo-classes include `:hover` (styling on hover), `:visited` (for visited links), and `:first-child` (selecting the first child of a parent).

```css
a:visited {  
  color: purple;  
}
```

```css
li:first-child {  
  font-weight: bold;  
}
```

#### Pseudo-Elements (`::`)
- Pseudo-elements are selected with double colons (`::`) and are used to style specific parts of an element or insert content.
- Example: `::before` and `::after` add content before or after an element's content.

```css
p::before {  
  content: ">> ";  
}
```

```css
p::after {  
  content: " <<";  
}
```

#### Conclusion
- The colon (`:`) selects pseudo-classes to style based on conditions like user interaction.
- The double colon (`::`) selects pseudo-elements to create or style specific parts of elements.
